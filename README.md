NLP analysis of Restaurant reviews

Restaurant reviews means critique of a restaurant, rating of a restaurant's qualities (food, service, prices, etc.) given by customers visited the restaurant. The importance of online reviews for restaurants has skyrocketed in recent years. Doing your best to gather positive restaurant reviews as examples of your stellar service should be a priority for any restaurant owner. It’s how customers choose the places where they’ll extend their patronage.

 The purposed method is to build a machine learning model with Natural Language Processing techniques that can capture the user's opinions as users reviews and then predictive analysis or algorithms in machine learning will be applied to categorize the fresh reviews as positive or negative.
